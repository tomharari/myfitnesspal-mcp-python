## How diary writes work

MyFitnessPal has no public API. Reads here are scraped from the website via
[`python-myfitnesspal`](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/python-myfitnesspal), and **diary
writes go through MFP's internal v2 JSON API** — the same one their web client uses,
authenticated with your existing session token.

That interface is undocumented and was determined by observing the web client. It works today,
but MyFitnessPal can change it without notice. They have already done so once: this server
originally posted to `/food/diary/{user}/add`, which now returns 404, leaving food logging
broken. If logging starts failing, that is the most likely cause.

### Deleting entries

MyFitnessPal returns an entry's ID **only in the response that creates it**. The diary page
exposes a different, legacy numeric ID that the delete endpoint rejects, and the API's diary
read returns meal-level totals with no per-entry IDs.

So this server records the IDs of entries it creates, in `~/.mfp_mcp/entries.json`. The practical
consequence:

- Entries logged **through this server** can be listed and deleted here
- Entries logged **in the MyFitnessPal app or website** cannot — delete those where you made them

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10–3.12** (check with `python3 --version`)

  Not 3.13+: `lxml`, pulled in by `myfitnesspal`, has no wheels for it and fails to build
  against the 3.14 C API. On macOS, `brew install python@3.12`.

- **pip 21.3+** (for pyproject.toml support; upgrade with `pip install --upgrade pip`)
- **MyFitnessPal account**
- **One of the following for authentication:**
  - Your MFP username/email and password (recommended), OR
  - Chrome or Firefox with an active MyFitnessPal login session

### Authentication Options

This MCP supports multiple authentication methods:

| Method | Setup | Persistence |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Credentials in config** | Add `MFP_USERNAME` and `MFP_PASSWORD` to Claude Desktop config | Automatic (session cached 30 days) |
| **Browser cookies** | Log into myfitnesspal.com in Chrome/Firefox | Until browser session expires |

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from Source (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/myfitnesspal-mcp-python.git
cd myfitnesspal-mcp-python

# Create virtual environment (use python3.10+ on macOS/Linux)
python3 -m venv venv
# On macOS, you may need to specify version: python3.12 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Upgrade pip (required for pyproject.toml support)
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install the package in editable mode
pip install -e .
```

### Option 2: Install with pip (when published)

```bash
pip install mfp-mcp
```

> **Note**: Option 2 requires the package to be published to PyPI. For now, use Option 1.

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify the server can start:

```bash
# With venv activated
python -m mfp_mcp.server
```

You should see the server waiting for input (it communicates via stdio). Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

To test authentication (optional):

```bash
MFP_USERNAME="your_email" MFP_PASSWORD="your_password" python -c "
from mfp_mcp.server import get_mfp_client
client = get_mfp_client()
print('Authentication successful!')
"
```

## Configuration for Claude Desktop

### Step 1: Locate Your Config File

| OS | Config File Location |
|----|---------------------|
| **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
| **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |

### Step 2: Add the MCP Server Configuration

If the file doesn't exist, create it. Add or merge the following configuration:

#### Option A: With Credentials (Recommended - No Browser Required)

**macOS Example:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "myfitnesspal": {
      "command": "/Users/yourname/myfitnesspal-mcp-python/venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "mfp_mcp.server"],
      "env": {
        "MFP_USERNAME": "your_email@example.com",
        "MFP_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Windows Example:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "myfitnesspal": {
      "command": "C:\\Users\\YourName\\myfitnesspal-mcp-python\\venv\\Scripts\\python.exe",
      "args": ["-m", "mfp_mcp.server"],
      "env": {
        "MFP_USERNAME": "your_email@example.com",
        "MFP_PASSWORD": "your_password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Option B: Without Credentials (Browser Cookie Fallback)

**macOS Example:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "myfitnesspal": {
      "command": "/Users/yourname/myfitnesspal-mcp-python/venv/bin/python",
      "args": ["-m", "mfp_mcp.server"]
    }
  }
}
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: Use **full absolute paths** to the Python executable in your virtual environment. Replace `yourname`/`YourName` with your actual username.

### Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop

After saving the config file, **completely quit and restart Claude Desktop** for the changes to take effect.

### Step 4: Verify Connection

In Claude Desktop, you should see a hammer icon (🔨) indicating MCP tools are available. Try asking:

> "Show my MyFitnessPal diary for today"

## Authentication Methods

The MCP server supports three authentication methods, tried in this order:

### 1. Environment Variables (Recommended)
Set `MFP_USERNAME` and `MFP_PASSWORD` in your Claude Desktop config's `env` section. This is the most reliable method and doesn't require a browser.

```json
"env": {
  "MFP_USERNAME": "your_email@example.com",
  "MFP_PASSWORD": "your_password"
}
```

### 2. Stored Session Cookies
After successful authentication, session cookies are saved to `~/.mfp_mcp/cookies.json`. These persist for 30 days, so you won't need to re-authenticate frequently.

### 3. Browser Cookies (Fallback)
If no credentials are provided and no stored cookies exist, the server falls back to reading cookies from Chrome or Firefox. You must be logged into myfitnesspal.com in your browser.

## Security Note on Credentials

Storing `MFP_PASSWORD` in your MCP client config puts your MyFitnessPal password in **plaintext
on disk**, readable by anything running as your user. It is convenient — the server can
re-authenticate indefinitely — but it is a real tradeoff, not a formality.

Prefer browser-cookie auth if you would rather not store the password: log into
myfitnesspal.com and the server reads the session from your browser. The cost is that MFP
sessions expire, so you will occasionally need to log in again.

Files this server writes to `~/.mfp_mcp/` (directory mode `0700`):

| File | Contents | Mode |
|------|----------|------|
| `cookies.json` | Session cookies — full account access, treat as a password | `0600` |
| `entries.json` | IDs of entries logged here, so they can be deleted | `0600` |

Note that this server can **modify your diary** — adding and deleting food entries, and updating
goals, measurements, and water. Deletion is limited to entries it created (see above), so it
cannot remove data logged in the app.

## Usage Examples

Once configured, you can interact with your MyFitnessPal data through Claude:

### Food Diary
```
"Show me what I ate today"
"Get my food diary for 2026-01-05"

docker run -it --rm \
  -v ~/.config/google-chrome:/root/.config/google-chrome:ro \
  mfp-mcp
```

## Troubleshooting

### "python: command not found" or wrong Python version

**Problem**: Python is not in PATH or you need to specify version.

**Solutions**:
1. On macOS/Linux, use `python3` instead of `python`
2. Check your version: `python3 --version` (must be 3.10+)
3. If needed, install Python 3.12 via Homebrew: `brew install python@3.12`
4. Then create venv with: `python3.12 -m venv venv`

### "pip install -e ." fails with "setup.py not found"

**Problem**: Your pip version is too old to support pyproject.toml builds.

**Solution**: Upgrade pip first:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

### "Failed to authenticate with MyFitnessPal"

**Problem**: The server can't authenticate with your credentials or read browser cookies.

**Solutions**:
1. **If using credentials**: Double-check your MFP_USERNAME and MFP_PASSWORD in the config
2. **If using browser cookies**: Make sure you're logged into myfitnesspal.com in Chrome or Firefox
3. Try logging out and back in to MyFitnessPal
4. Clear browser cookies and log in fresh
5. On **macOS**, grant **Full Disk Access** to Claude Desktop:
   - System Settings → Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access
   - Add Claude.app

### "No module named 'mfp_mcp'"

**Problem**: Package not installed or wrong Python environment.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you're using the correct Python from your virtual environment
2. Reinstall the package: `pip install -e .`
3. Verify the path in your Claude Desktop config points to the venv Python:
   ```
   /path/to/project/venv/bin/python  # macOS/Linux
   C:\path\to\project\venv\Scripts\python.exe  # Windows
   ```

### Tools not appearing in Claude Desktop

**Problem**: MCP server not connecting.

**Solutions**:
1. Check the config file syntax (must be valid JSON - use a JSON validator)
2. Use **absolute paths** in the configuration (no `~` or relative paths)
3. Restart Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q on macOS, then relaunch)
4. Check Claude Desktop logs:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\`

### Empty responses or no data

**Problem**: Authentication works but no data returned.

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you have data logged in MyFitnessPal for the requested date
2. Check the date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
3. Try a recent date where you know you have entries

### Double parentheses in terminal prompt like "((venv) )"

**Problem**: VS Code/Cursor Python extension bug with venv prompt.

**Solutions**:
1. Update the Python extension in VS Code/Cursor
2. Or manually fix the venv activate script - change line ~70 in `venv/bin/activate`:
   ```bash
   # Change from:
   PS1="("'(venv) '") ${PS1:-}"
   # To:
   PS1="(venv) ${PS1:-}"
   ```
